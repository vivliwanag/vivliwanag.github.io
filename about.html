            Creating visual art pieces has always been a passion of mine since I remember picking up a pencil for the first time. 
            I love drawing realism portraits and compositions of everyday life. I first started out with traditional painting and colouring but
            during the pandemic I ventured out into creating digital artworks. During the pandemic I completed a challenge of creating an artwork
            a day for 30 days straight. Most of my artworks included are from the time of completing the challenge.

            <br>
            <br> 
            Photography is one of many artforms I enjoy. I was 12 years old when I first worked professionally as a photographer for my dad's photography and DJing company.
            I was his second photographer for a wedding at the Old Mill. My favourite genre of photography is street photography because it captures the raw and candid life of the city. </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        Since 2020, I've worked on book covers, YouTube thumbnails, you name it! Using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, my passion for graphic design has grown throughout the years. I draw inspiration from graphic designers like Peter Saville, Helmut Krone, and Saul Bass.                    </p>

        I'm a self-taught video editor and filmer. Starting in 2015, I have many years of experience using Adobe Premiere Pro, CapCut, and Final Cut Pro. I enjoy creating and editing videos and I offer video styles that range from corporate to fun/high-energy content. In 2015 I created my first YouTube channel, and learned a lot through trial and error. To see more of what I do, click here!

                    <h1>Artwork</h1>
                    <p>Creating visual art pieces has always been a passion of mine since I remember picking up a pencil for the first time. 
                        I love drawing realism portraits and compositions of everyday life. I first started out with traditional painting and colouring but
                        during the pandemic I ventured out into creating digital artworks. During the pandemic I completed a challenge of creating an artwork
                        a day for 30 days straight. Most of my artworks included are from the time of completing the challenge.

                    <h1>Photography</h1>
                    <p>Photography is one of many artforms I enjoy. I was 12 years old when I first worked professionally as a photographer for my dad's photography and DJing company.
                        I was his second photographer for a wedding at the Old Mill. My favourite genre of photography is street photography because it captures the raw and candid life of the city. </p>

                    <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
                    <p>Since 2020, I've worked on book covers, YouTube thumbnails, you name it! Using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, my passion for graphic design has grown throughout the years. I draw inspiration from graphic designers like Peter Saville, Helmut Krone, and Saul Bass.                    </p>
